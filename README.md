# Cab Catchers 

## Project Objectives
1. Summary Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between different data elements.

2. Identify Traffic Zones: Utilize clustering algorithms to group trips and identify distinct traffic zones within the city.

3. Predict Taxi Traffic: Develop models to predict taxi traffic based on factors such as airport, season, day of the week, and time of the day.

4. Predict Revenue/Profitability: Create models to forecast revenue and profitability based on the provided dataset.
Technologies and Languages
To accomplish the project objectives, the following technologies and languages are recommended:

## Programming Languages:

Python
Pandas 
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

## Data Processing and Cleaning:

OpenPyXL
## Requirements
Unzip green_tripdata_2021.zip  in /Alice/Resource 
Note: green_tripdata_2021.csv file used by in Alice Resources folder has been zipped due size limitation

## Conclusion
This project requires a combination of data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling techniques to gain insights from the provided dataset. By leveraging Python and its associated libraries, such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, you can perform data analysis, identify traffic zones, and build predictive models to forecast taxi traffic, revenue, and profitability.

Additionally, using Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation will help create an interactive and easily shareable project workflow.
